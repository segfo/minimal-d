you can make the program with

make -f Makefile.bare

nothing super special is needed, just a linux gcc that can make 32 bit programs.

the exe will be called minimal. running it on linux will result in a segfault (since it will try to write to video memory) but if you copy it on to the grub floppy it will work there, or use it on qemu -kernel

Easiest: just run "qemu -kernel minimal"


Floppy method:
	to copy on to the floppy i mount it as a loopback device on linux, copy the file, then umount
	you can run with qemu like this
	qemu -fda floppy.img

	you can get floppy.img from
	http://arsdnet.net/dcode/floppy.img

	I think the floppy will work on a real computer too if you wanted to write it to a disk,
	but idk for sure.
